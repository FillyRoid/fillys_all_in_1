# fillys_all_in_1

This is my application for fast using some elements and functions (like volume and keys for fast opening other applications)
The idea started with volume. in linux mint, if you have there more than 1 monitor, you get the volume setting only on the main monitor.
Thats why I started to make a new combine applications for regular using.

## Current useful things:
1. volume setting
2. keys for other applications (like Screenshot Tool and Calculator)
